# WPF-SQL-Injection-Test
A very simple(really simple actually) WPF app to show some SQL injection examples.

I will keep updating this repository with more SQL Injection examples, I am working on a OWASP training and I would like to demonstrate how to avoid this issue in a simple way.

SQL injection is not c# issue, but a SQL interpreter one. The idea of the code is just to show the user how this attack happens and how you can protect your code with some simple steps.
